Focusing especially (but not exclusively) on African American music and musicians, we consider how music informs modes of resistance tied to race, class, gender, and sexuality. In addition to asking how music can resist extant arrangements of power, we also consider the types of futures that music can imagine.</p>",1,,,,,HTBA,,Sun Jul 29 2018 11:34:55 GMT-0500 (CDT),201803

From the first, this project was attached to a musical thinking that is evident in such foundational voices as Vico and Rousseau. But the role of music was not a static one. Instead we can trace the shift from an eighteenth-century view of music as a universal human activity to a nineteenth-century privileging of the European musical achievement (Hanslick, Wagner, Nietzsche), and then, in the twentieth century, to a struggle between Eurocentrism and the reassertion of the postcolonial, global view, in figures from Adorno and Suzanne Langer to Edward Said and Paul Gilroy. Throughout this history, the shifting roles of music posed a challenge to disciplines and modes of thought reliant first and foremost on language. This course examines the dilemmas of music’s position in the human sciences, at once foundational and marginal, and aim to point the way forward to a truly musical human science of the twenty-first century.   </p>",1,,This course meets during the <i>Reading Period</i>: the week between the last week of classes and finals week.

Likewise, what role can the city play in establishing, interrogating, and extrapolating the limits of architecture, whether as a practice, a discourse, or a physical manifestation of human endeavor in the material environment? This course addresses these and other related questions, seeking to position architecture in its broader urban, social, cultural, political, intellectual, and aesthetic contexts. In so doing, it assumes the position that the nature and character of the urban can largely be characterized in terms of the manner in which we, as a society, conceive, construct, and contribute to notions of “the public,” or “the common.”</p>

This course seeks to acquaint students with the nature, dimensions, and history of insurgency and counterinsurgency both past and present and establish a solid foundation upon which expertise and analytical capabilities can be developed for future application. The course also considers a wide range of questions to provide students with a deeper understanding of the evolution of insurgent strategy and tactics over time and the development of government counterinsurgency doctrine. Questions include: What is insurgency and how does it differ from guerrilla warfare and terrorism? Why and how do insurgencies develop? How have strategies and tactics of insurgents changed over time? Who are the foremost ideological and doctrinal proponents of insurgency and why? Who are the foremost counterinsurgency practitioner-theorists? Why does insurgency succeed or fail? How can insurgency best be fought? Why the wheel is seemingly always “reinvented” in counterinsurgency? Finally, the course aims to analyze both the effectiveness of insurgency as a means to achieve political change and the challenges faced by the liberal democratic state in responding to insurgent campaigns and challenges.</p>",1,,,"<div class=""instructor-detail"">Isaiah Wilson</div>","<div class=""meet"">F 9:25am-11:15am</div>",HTBA,,Sun Jul 29 2018 11:34:55 GMT-0500 (CDT),201803

We explore the ways in which the first waves of crusaders thought of themselves as militant pilgrims, combining their war to recapture the Holy Land with a spiritual pilgrimage to the place where medieval Christians believed that Christ had lived and died. We also consider how important changes in Christian spirituality affected the crusading movement as it matured, as well as the converse—how the crusading experience profoundly changed Christian spiritual practices. In this seminar, students also examine the culture of crusading and of the hybrid society that western Christians forged in the east from Islamic, Byzantine, and western Christian cultures. We look at crusader literature, songs, and chronicles alongside the architecture, artistic products, and other artifacts of the crusading world. We follow the crusading enterprise as it turned against targets other than Islam over the course of the thirteenth century, including supposedly heretical Christians in southern France. The course concludes by considering the abiding influence of the crusading ideal beyond the Middle Ages themselves, examining the modern uses and appropriations of the idea of crusade and crusading.</p>",1,,,"<div class=""instructor-detail"">Kevin Lord</div>","<div class=""meet"">Th 3:30pm-5:20pm</div>",HTBA,,Sun Jul 29 2018 11:34:55 GMT-0500 (CDT),201803

Some questions we address are: how did the history of Muslim sovereignty continue to inform colonial and nationalist self-definitions? How did Islamic institutions reform under colonialism and under what circumstances did Islamic revivalists resist colonial rule? To what extent were these developments connected with or separate from processes in other parts of the British empire? In response to these questions, students consider a range of variables, such as the influence of a modernizing Muslim ideologues, the role of Christian missionaries, the introduction of the printing press, and the creation of modern madrasa schools. Students also trace the emergence of electoral politics and the violent partition of India in the twentieth century, and address how contemporary South Asian Muslim identities intersected with other articulations of identity such as caste, gender, class, and political ideologies.</p>",1,,,,"<div class=""meet"">M 1:30pm-3:20pm</div>",HTBA,,Sun Jul 29 2018 11:34:55 GMT-0500 (CDT),201803

The medical gaze, systems of quantification, rubrics of ‘normality,’ eugenics, intelligence testing–each of these tools of science have reinforced hierarchies of difference while devaluing the experiences of persons with non-conforming bodies and brains. In this course we explore this fairly recent history, focusing on the experiences of people with a range of disabilities through the prism of modern science, medicine, and technology. From prosthetic limbs to neuro-enhancing drugs, we examine how nineteenth and twentieth century sciences have shaped definitions and experiences of disability.

Rather than taking a Eurocentric point of view, this course encourages a more entangled view of the Americas, a perspective based in this hemisphere with an understanding of the external Atlantic and Pacific connections as well as the internal flow of people and objects within the Americas. Lectures focus on the indigenous world and consider how Spanish, Portuguese, French, English, and Dutch settlers initially attempted to recreate their familiar worlds and the impact of African and Asian slaves. Lectures, readings, and object study sessions provide thematic explorations into the interaction among the various cultures, the rise of class distinctions, and the cultural meanings of domestic objects. This course also explores the effect of colonial policy on importation and local production, the impact of imported objects and immigrant craftsmen upon local craft structures, and the effect of trade and mobility within the colonies.  </p>",1,,,"<div class=""instructor-detail"">Edward Cooke</div>","<div class=""meet"">TTh 10:30am-11:20am<span class=""meet-room-201803""> in LORIA B51</span></div>

And yet, in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, classicism was revolutionary, inspiring, and regenerative. Classical art and architecture fueled the imagination and provided contemporary artists with new ways—material and philosophical—to reinvigorate the fine arts. Excavations in Rome, Herculaneum and Pompeii vividly evoked the lived reality of the past, and Greek art and architecture’s austere forms provided an alternative to Baroque and Rococo extravagance. Neoclassicism was not the stale recreation of dusty ruins and abandoned monuments; it was the key to modernity. This course examines the way artists in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries explored the revolutionary possibilities of classical art in painting, sculpture, architecture and the decorative arts. We take a thematic, trans-European approach and study some of the great figures of the period, including the philosopher Johann Winckelmann, the sculptors Antonio Canova and Bertel Thorvaldsen, the painters Angelika Kauffman, Jacques-Louis David, Anne-Louis Girodet, J.A.D.

Looking across media, we explore examples of portraiture in painting, sculpture, and print and address how works within the genre speak to both individual and communal identity, to issues of gender, race, and class, and reflect the exploration of social mobility from the late fourteenth to the late sixteenth century.

It seeks to bring a multicultural framework to the understanding of the early modern period. We examine the role of images, material exchange, and visual reckoning in the emergence and trajectory of key early modern institutions and endeavors that, in turn, helped shape our current world: the Atlantic slave trade, representations of otherness in European and non-European art, religious encounters and conflicts, visual and material exchange in scientific explorations, imperialism, and colonialism. Special attention is given to the enduring effects of these interactions in contemporary European societies and emphasis is brought to a critical consideration of the idea of the Renaissance and Early Modernity as a keystone of histories of ‘Western’ art, culture, and science.</p>",1,,,"<div class=""instructor-detail"">Cecile Fromont</div>","<div class=""meet"">T 1:30pm-3:20pm<span class=""meet-room-201803""> in LORIA 259</span></div>",HTBA,,Sun Jul 29 2018 11:34:55 GMT-0500 (CDT),201803

The medical gaze, systems of quantification, rubrics of ‘normality,’ eugenics, intelligence testing–each of these tools of science have reinforced hierarchies of difference while devaluing the experiences of persons with non-conforming bodies and brains. In this course we explore this fairly recent history, focusing on the experiences of people with a range of disabilities through the prism of modern science, medicine, and technology. From prosthetic limbs to neuro-enhancing drugs, we examine how nineteenth and twentieth century sciences have shaped definitions and experiences of disability.

Instead of focusing on the biography of a single drug, or class of drugs, this course incorporates a wide range of substances, including alcohol, cigarettes, pharmaceuticals, and narcotics. For each session, students read a selection of essays, book chapters, and primary source material, and then discuss how certain ways of using and selling drugs have been sanctioned and encouraged, while others have been pathologized or criminalized. We explore how drug definitions are constructed, how they shift over time, how they affect (and are affected by) people who use, sell, and regulate drugs. Throughout the course, films, images, music, and television episodes are presented as objects of analysis to provide insight into the cultural lives of drugs.

An introduction into Kafka’s world of writing is offered by the reading of pieces form his early work (<em>Description of a Struggle</em>), the novel <em>The Trial</em> (with Orson Welles’s movie), and the late narrative <em>Josephine, the Singer</em>. The philosophers to read on Kafka (and in their own context) are Albert Camus, Walter Benjamin, Theodor W.

Through readings in Israeli poetry and fiction we study political theology of Jewish sovereignty as a hermeneutical code to understanding Israeli literature as it represents chasms and contacts within Israeli society.

Modern Western music notation is introduced through a study of its historical development as a tool for vocal literacy. Topics include mode, scale, rhythm, meter, and form. Lectures introduce theoretical concepts in their epistemological, cultural, and historical contexts, and small-group recitation and improvisation sessions turn these concepts into musical intuitions. Principles of modal and tonal organization are introduced by modeling repertories including Vedic chant, Torah cantillation, Byzantine psalm intonation, and Carolingian chant. Interdependencies between melodic design, musical meter, and poetic prosody are explored through immersion in a repertory of folk hymnody from the Second Great Awakening, a major site of antebellum musical contact between Americans of European and African descent. Willingness to sing is essential for this course, though talent is not a prerequisite. No experience with musical notation is required.</p>",1,,,"<div class=""instructor-detail"">Ian Quinn</div>",,HTBA,,Sun Jul 29 2018 11:34:55 GMT-0500 (CDT),201803

From the first, this project was attached to a musical thinking that is evident in such foundational voices as Vico and Rousseau. But the role of music was not a static one. Instead we can trace the shift from an eighteenth-century view of music as a universal human activity to a nineteenth-century privileging of the European musical achievement (Hanslick, Wagner, Nietzsche), and then, in the twentieth century, to a struggle between Eurocentrism and the reassertion of the postcolonial, global view, in figures from Adorno and Suzanne Langer to Edward Said and Paul Gilroy. Throughout this history, the shifting roles of music posed a challenge to disciplines and modes of thought reliant first and foremost on language. This course examines the dilemmas of music’s position in the human sciences, at once foundational and marginal, and aim to point the way forward to a truly musical human science of the twenty-first century.   </p>",1,,This course meets during the <i>Reading Period</i>: the week between the last week of classes and finals week.

This moment was the culmination of a long historical arc, in which religious identities were transformed and politicized under colonialism. This course examines this process, tracing the development of a spectrum of modern Muslim subjectivities from the advent of colonial rule to the present. Some questions we address are: how did the history of Muslim sovereignty continue to inform colonial and nationalist self-definitions? How did Islamic institutions reform under colonialism and under what circumstances did Islamic revivalists resist colonial rule? To what extent were these developments connected with or separate from processes in other parts of the British empire? In response to these questions, students consider a range of variables, such as the influence of a modernizing Muslim ideologues, the role of Christian missionaries, the introduction of the printing press, and the creation of modern madrasa schools. Students also trace the emergence of electoral politics and the violent partition of India in the twentieth century, and address how contemporary South Asian Muslim identities intersected with other articulations of identity such as caste, gender, class, and political ideologies.</p>",1,,,,"<div class=""meet"">M 1:30pm-3:20pm</div>",HTBA,,Sun Jul 29 2018 11:34:55 GMT-0500 (CDT),201803

Solo performance is at once an old and new art form: Homer sang the Odyssey by himself; Hamlet stands alone onstage questioning his own ontology and the nature of being in general. Priests, stand-up comedians, monologuists, TED-talkers: all solo artists. These instances demand of the actor the very specific and unusual kind of presentness that characterizes solo performance. And for the director of solo performance, the challenges are also very particular: how to establish the actor’s relationship to the audience, and how to direct the audience to the actor, be it as scene partner, as confidante, as eavesdropper, as a body of concerned witnesses. This course examines all dramatic modes of aloneness onstage, all the way through from the thinking-aloud of the soliloquy, the <em>in-medias-res</em> monologue, the stand-up comedy routine. Text analysis is followed by the study of acting techniques in best accordance with any given text. Students have the opportunity to perform classic monologues, as well as to explore modern performance texts and comedic performance. Students are also required to take on responsibilities for directing others in focusing and shaping solo work, and therefore thinking about the way aloneness on stage signifies, in ways that are both similar and very different to traditional, multicharacter scene work.</p>",1,,,"<div class=""instructor-detail"">Deborah Margolin</div>","<div class=""meet"">MW 3:30pm-5:20pm</div>",HTBA,,Sun Jul 29 2018 11:34:55 GMT-0500 (CDT),201803

Although the paper's requirements vary with the project and its adviser, it must be more than a rehearsal log. The paper typically engages interpretative and performance issues as revealed in other productions of the work (if they exist). The writing should be concomitant with rehearsal, to enable each to inform the other, and a draft must be presented to, and commented on by, the adviser at least a week before—not after—the final performance.

This course argues otherwise. Specifically, we consider the intersections between the current dominant political economic mode, referred to as neoliberal capitalism, and sexuality as a field of power. We analyze how subjectivities are formed under this current system, how desires are produced and discourses incited, and how the particular <em>moralization </em>of economic behavior has implications for a range of issues including reproductive justice, definitions of kinship, sexual liberation movements, and contemporary states of war and emergency. Thinking of sexuality as a field of power that is predicated on notions of normality and abnormality enables us to see what other “undesirable” subjects are produced under conditions of neoliberal capitalist modernity with whom sexual others are always in kinship.</p>
